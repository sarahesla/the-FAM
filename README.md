`Assignment 1` will be your first taste of designing a somewhat complex object oriented program. Take care to think through your code and always ask the question: "Does this code belong here? What is this class responsible for?".
  - **Deadline:** 16th October : 11:59 PM
  - Late submissions will suffer a grade penalty of 5% of the total grade per day.
  - The last commit as of the deadline mentioned above will be graded. In the event of a late submission please reach out to me via Discord or email so that I can grade the correct commit.
  - Remember to have fun and reach out if you need any assistance or have any questions!

#### How to Use
1. Begin by setting up your account. The program will lead you through a
 series of questions that allow you to customize your FAM.  
 You will enter:
   - Personal details
   - Bank Account details
   - Amounts for each budget category  
 
2. Choose your account type.
    - Angel  
    Angels never get locked out of a budget category. They are warned
    when they exceed 90% of a budget.
    - Troublemaker  
    Troublemakers are warned when they exceed 75% of a budget category.
    That category is locked if they exceed it by 120%.
    - Rebel  
    Rebels are aggressively warned when they exceed 50% of a budget category.
    Once they use up 100% of that category, it is locked. If they exceed
    two categories, the whole account is locked.

3. The rest of the program works exactly like you think it does! Just follow
the instructions in the console.
